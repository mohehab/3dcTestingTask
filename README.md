# vue-test

This is a simple Vue/Vuex/Nuxt project which along with a default Nuxt welcome shows a list of Github repos for `vue` or `nuxt` depending on the button clicked.

As a testing task the following changes are required

 1. Add another button on the main page along with "Vue" and "Nuxt" which will show any other Github repos query (you decide which) in the same way the existing buttons do it.
 1. Show a total number of repos found for active query in Github
 1. Add a checkbox nearby, which will hide the new button when checked
 1. Make the app look nicer and more user friendly (at your discretion)
 1. Try to make the app code better, freely changing the existing code to the state you like it more
 1. Describe why you think it is better.
 1. Provide the result as a GIT *.patch file with all the change you have made.
 1. Add some comments regarding the project code base itself:
    1. What you think is good about it?
    1. What don't you like about it?
    1. What would you change, add to make the code better?
